I worked on creating a simple projection of lines that interconnected the blob detection points. This allowed me to create simple
geometric shapes. I experimented with connecting on what the webcam projected but then had talked to a fellow classmate
who thought that it would look interesting with black instead of the webcam. My final choice was to go with a higher number of lines
within the blob area to decern the shape and outline of a person. It does not look like an exact outline but is enough to make it
look like a profile of a face. I used the map and random functions to change the colors of the lines alternating so it would have 
an almost 3D effect, and keep the image from looking as flat. The image looked more flat with just one color so I tried to make it more 
engaging by changing the colors of the lines.
